Our Principles
World map is all about where you are and getting to where you want to be. We help you achieve more. So we can help you, sometimes we'll need to know some things about you. While we collect and use your data, we fully understand that you value your privacy.

We believe privacy is about freedom and being able to decide for yourself how your data is used and by whom. This is why we have established our Privacy Principles:

1. We will always keep you fully informed about your data

We make sure you understand which data from or about you we use, why we use it, how long we use it and who can use it.

2. We enable you to remain in control of your data

We consider the data from or about you to be yours. We only use it for the purposes for which you have given it to us, or for which we collected it from you. At any time you can opt-out or opt-in using our software and websites.

3. We protect your data

Your data is yours. We keep it that way by protecting it as best as we reasonably can to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.
